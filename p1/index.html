<h1>Asha Mathur</h1>

<p class="style1">I have been working in marketing capacities for many years, and have always been interested in learning how to build effective websites.  My limited experience in HTML has given me a small glimpse of the possibilities, and I hope to learn much more through this class.</p> 

<p class="style1">My website is hosted through A Small Orange (shocker, right?!?), and I am using the 'Tiny' plan.</p>

<p class="style1">I am using Coda 2 for code editing.</p>

<p class="style1">My git repository is located <a href="https://github.com/AshaM">here.</a></p>
